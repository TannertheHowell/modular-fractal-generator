# Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

* [x] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!
* [x] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
    *   List what you already know how to do.
    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
* [x] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    *   Explain what form the output will take.
* [x] List the algorithms that will be used (but don't write them yet).
* [x] Tag the last commit in this phase `analyzed`
    * *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed by midnight on the Sunday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

To start I got all the files cloned from the repository and made sure that git was correctly set up before I even opened
a file to make sure I didn't make any unintended changes. The overall of this project is to take a code that is filled with
'code smells', things ranging from useless lines of code to deceptive comments. We have been tasked to keep the functionality 
and user experience the same while fixing up and reformatting the code. 

While reformatting the code we will be working on a 'Code Smells' .md file to track the 10 different types of smells, where
they are and how we might go about tackling the issues. We don't have to give full explanations again and again for fixing 
the same type of smell, like global variables can be explained once, after that they can be mentioned that another instance 
of the smell occurred elsewhere. This includes tons of other issues like dead code, using the wrong data structures, bad
variable names or changing variables after they're never called again. Lots of issues to find, record and fix (plus test!)

The code then needs to be split into 6 different modules:
* main.py
  * This is the short entry point to the program. It deals with the command line arguments and imports modules for the PNGs
* FractalInformation.py
  * Fractal configurations and a dictionary for both Mandelbrot and Phoenix config data goes here
* Mandelbrot.py
  * Function for the complex plane, returning the iteration count for the Mandelbrot
* Phoenix.py
  * Same ideas as the Mandelbrot but for the Phoenix function
* Palette.py
  * Deals with the colors using an array of strings that rae the colors.
  * This has two palettes, one for each type of function
* ImagePainter.py
  * Uses Tk and a PhotoImage object to store the pixes for the PNG file

During this the unit tests must be maintained. There are 6 to start with, at the end of the project those 6 all need to
be working and two more need to be added (they must add to the code, they can't be fluff). 

Another part of the project will be making a UML diagram for the project as well as a user manual. The manual should grow 
with the project and make it easy for others to use the program. 

While making changes don't forget to use 'cmp' to make sure that the images produced are exactly the same as the packup
PNG files that were saved from the stat of the project. Those backup PNGs will get placed in the backup folder in the project
and used along the way to ensure consistency in the images. All of mine turned out fine and were saved in the backup folder,
all the unit tests passed as well. 

The starter quiz was a bit rough on the first go through, after going through Phase 1 I think I'll have a better grasp on
what I need to know. 

The current program prints out the correct fractal images, from what I can currently tell. The issue at hand is cutting
out all the unnecessary bloat out of the project. From reading over the source code there seem to be multiple instances
of most, if not all the code smells. I will need to make small changes, test them and then commit them once I make sure 
it is still working correctly. 

If I get this project to its final state, that would look like the same thing as its current state (when it comes to the 
end user experience), while massively cleaning up things behind the scenes. The end product should also have more thorough
unit tests to ensure it's quality as well. 

The data used in this project will be the fractal equations, which I don't currently understand, but we don't need to. The
user's input and any constants we may need. Most of the information in this project seems to be stored in arrays or 
dictionaries. The algorithms that will get used will be for the Mandelbrot and Phoenix functions. 

## Phase 1: Design (tag name `designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

* [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
* [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
* Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing
* [ ] Tag the last commit in this phase `designed`
    * *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed by midnight on the Sunday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

Part of the design for this project is to make it more modular, split up the initial 3 .py files into 6 .py files. Those
files are as follows:

* main.py
* FractalInformation.py
* Palette.py
* ImagePainter.py
* Mandelbrot.py
* Phoenix.py

The pseudocode for the Phoenix and Mandelbrot algorithms are as follows (I tried ChatGPT for the pseudocode): 

FUNCTION phoenix_main(i):
    # Set up global variables
    DECLARE tkPhotoImage, win, s

    # Record start time for performance measurement
    b4 = GET_CURRENT_TIME()

    # Initialize GUI
    win = INITIALIZE_GUI()

    # Generate fractal image
    tkPhotoImage = GENERATE_FRACTAL_IMAGE(f[i], grad, s)

    # Save image to file if requested
    IF Save_As_Picture:
        SAVE_IMAGE_TO_FILE(tkPhotoImage, i)

    # Display instructions to exit program
    DISPLAY_EXIT_INSTRUCTIONS()

    # Run GUI main loop
    RUN_GUI_MAIN_LOOP()

FUNCTION getColorFromPalette(z):
    # Set up global variables
    DECLARE grad, win

    # Set constants
    c = complex(0.5667, 0.0)
    phoenix = complex(-0.5, 0.0)

    # Flip the components of the complex number
    zFlipped = FLIP_COMPLEX_COMPONENTS(z)

    # Initialize previous Z value
    zPrev = 0+0j

    # Iterate over color palette
    FOR i IN 0 TO 101:
        # Save current Z value
        zSave = z

        # Calculate new Z value
        z = z * z + c + (pheonix * zPrev)

        # Save previous Z value for next iteration
        zPrev = zSave

        # Check if Z has exceeded the absolute value of 2
        IF abs(z) > 2:
            # Return color from palette
            RETURN COLOR_FROM_PALETTE(grad, i)

function PixelColorOrIndex(c, palette)
    z = complex(0, 0)
    MAX_ITERATIONS = 100
    if palette is not None then
        len = size of palette
        TWO = 2
        for iter in range(len) do
            z = z * z + c
            if abs(z) > TWO then
                z = TWO
                if iter >= len then
                    iter = len - 1
                end if
                return palette[iter]
            end if
        end for
    else
        len = MAX_ITERATIONS
        TWO = 2
        for iter in range(len) do
            z = z * z + c
            if abs(z) > TWO then
                z = TWO
                if iter == MAX_ITERATIONS then
                    iter = MAX_ITERATIONS - 1
                end if
                return iter
            end if
        end for
    end if
    return palette[iter] if palette is not None and iter < size of palette else iter
end function

function paint(fractals, imagename, window)
    palette = []
    img = []
    fractal = fractals[imagename]
    minx = fractal['centerX'] - (fractal['axisLen'] / 2.0)
    maxx = fractal['centerX'] + (fractal['axisLen'] / 2.0)
    miny = fractal['centerY'] - (fractal['axisLen'] / 2.0)
    maxy = fractal['centerY'] + (fractal['axisLen'] / 2.0)
    canvas = Canvas(window, width=512, height=512, bg='#000000')
    canvas.pack()
    canvas.create_image((256, 256), image=img, state="normal")
end function

After doing it this way I felt like I did not have as great of a grasp on the code as when I had to write out the pseudocode
myself on other assignments. If I have extra time at the end of this then I will go back and probably rewrite this.
