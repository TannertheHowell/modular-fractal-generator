# Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `5.1-analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [x] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!
*   [x] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
    *   List what you already know how to do.
    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
*   [x] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    *   Explain what form the output will take.
*   [x] List the algorithms that will be used (but don't write them yet).
*   [x] Tag the last commit in this phase `analyzed`
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed by midnight on the Sunday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

The overarching goal of this assignment is to continue the project from Assignment 5, but in an object-oriented design 
that is easily modifiable and easier to test or extend. While the base of the project is used, new documentation, SDP, 
user manuals and UML diagrams will be needed for this assignment. There are quite a few different sections. The Requirements
document goes over the sections, so I'll split up my breakdown by each of those sections as well:


### Documentation:
* New UML, user's manual and SDP, all while using new 5.1 tags to keep things straight. The program also will no longer
give usage messages, instead the user's manual should explain how to do everything-aka, it's going to get longer. 

### Unit Tests:
* Like the last section there needs to be 8 solid, "non-trivial" unit tests that follow the quality guidelines.

### Fractal Classes:
* An initial Fractal class is needed that is abstract with 4 concrete subclasses
* Its purpose is to be the 'common structure' for the concrete classes though inheritance
* This also has a placeholder 'count()' method for an exception until it's changed by other classes
* I can define data members in the Fractal class as well as defining other methods as I see fit
* Two of the concrete classes need to be new patterns (based off of the patterns from Phoenix and Mandelbrot)
* The Fractal class is not related to the Palettes or the Colors classes

### Fractal Factory:
* A new class or module that is responsible for the concrete fractal objects
* This module or class needs to have a default for a fractal configuration if none are given
* If a fractal is missing or has issues, let 'open()' handle the failure message

### FractalParser:
* Another new class or module that reads the '.frac' files and turns them into usable information for the program
* Handle the file one line at a time, removing things like case as you go to make it into a key/value pair dictionary
* Be careful on converting strings to their correct type (int or float using the appropriate conversion), code is provided

### Palette Classes:
* An abstract class with two concrete subclasses that has the common structure for the concrete classes, it does not make 
Palette objects though, instead it uses inheritance 
* The concrete subclasses inherit from Palette and have their own 'getColor()' implementations
  * This is where the new color palettes will come into play allowing for palettes between 64 and 512 iterations
* This is where we need to use the 'colour' module along with 'Color.range_to()' for the color palettes.
  * Careful on the palettes to ensure a large enough difference between colors to avoid it being washed out

### PaletteFactory:
* A class or module that follows the 'Factory Method Pattern' that 'instantiate objects embodying palettes'
  * It returns a concrete palette object
* This is the only place where Palette classes are imported
* Without a specified palette, a default palette should be used (defined here, not in main.py))

### ImagePainter:
* A class where 'tkinter' is imported and used (the only place!) that employs the 'Strategy Design Pattern' when calling
the '.count()' method
* The constructor uses 'FractalFactory', 'PaletteFactory' and 'FractalParser' as input

### User Interface:
* The user interface will be mostly the same as last time, but it will not show a list of all the fractals when one is 
not given
* Both the 'FRACTAL_FILE' and the 'PALETTE_NAME' inputs are optional with defaults when they are missing
  * No usage message is printed if a default is used, this information should be in the user manual instead
* The same style as Assignment 5 is used for the file naming

### Default Fractal:
* The max size is 640x640 and the min size is 256x256 with an iteration count between 64 and 256
* It should be one of the 'fascinating' fractal designs, not a 'boring' one
* The default configuration SHOULD be hard coded into the program, not an external .frac file

### Fractal Configuration File Format:
* The fractal configurations need to follow the examples from the other .frac files, pretty much the opposite of the 
'invalid.frac' file
* Lines starting with a '#' and all white spaces are ignored as well as the ordering of configuration items doesn't matter

* These are all valid items in the fractal configuration files:
  * 'type' (string)
    * Figures out which fractal formula to use
  * 'centerX' (float)
    * Center on the x-axis
  * 'centerY' (float)
    * Center on the y-axis
  * 'AxisLength' (float)
    * Size of the complex plane
      * A small value makes for a more zoomed-in image, larger value makes for a more zoomed-out image
  * 'pixels' (int)
    * The width/height of the image 
  * 'iterations' (int)
    * The amount of iterations for the for loop before going to black for the color (larger will take more time)

* These are optional:
  * 'creal' and 'cimag' (float) 
    * The real and imaginary components of the 'C' constant for the Julia formula

### Abstract Classes Library:
* There is the 'abc' library, but it's not needed on this assignment and can add more complexity than it's worth

Another part of the assignment is creating four concrete subclasses of Fractal, two of which are the Mandelbrot and the 
Phoenix fractals. The other two can be one of the given fractal formulae or the use of a "Higher powers" version of a 
Mandelbrot or Julia fractal, but that can only be used for one of the four. 

In the end of the project the program should still run at about the same speed, but with more functionality, better error 
handling and built-in defaults when prompts are missing. The input in this case will be a mix of user input for the type 
of fractal and the color palette used. There will be the external .frac files that are also used. Good input should lead
to the correct fractal being generated in a reasonable amount of time while bad input should produce a helpful error
message (or in the case of missing input, a default fractal should be shown). In the case of an error being thrown, the 
user manual should have instructions on how to continue or how to fix the issue in the future. 



## Phase 1: Design (tag name `5.1-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

* [x] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
* [x] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
* Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing
* [x] Tag the last commit in this phase `designed`
    * *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed by midnight on the Sunday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*
