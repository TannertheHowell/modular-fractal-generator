# A color palette is an array of colors; colors are simple strings
# This file will contain two color palettes
# The following statements hold true for a color palette named P:
#     * When the Mandelbrot or Phoenix fractal function returns an iteration count of a point in the complex plane, the corresponding pixel is painted the color of P[count]
#     * Your program should never allow count >= len(P)
#     * Remember, neither Mandelbrot.py nor Phoenix.py should import Palette; find another way to share len(p) with their functions
